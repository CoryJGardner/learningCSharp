title: "Second week - some progress, some frustrations ..."
date: 2023-02-07
---

This week consisted in a series of frustrations relating primarily to:
1) Visual Studio's Git Integration
2) Confusion in understanding the basic operation of Visual Studio (including the difference between project and solution and compiling a single file in a project with several .cs files)
3) Getting the correct .NET version and setting it up in a project.
4) My code block is not rendering properly on the Github "pages", but looks fine on my Github: https://github.com/CoryJGardner/learningCSharp/blob/main/_posts/2023-02-07-title.md

While I am still figuring some of these things out, I managed to write and compile a very simple console-application ATM simulator (an idea from class) and experiment with case statements, user input from the console, and tests in C#

  # Basic ATM simulator (the PIN is 1234)

```
    using System;  
    using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;  
    using static System.Net.Mime.MediaTypeNames;  

    class atm  
    {  
        public static void Main()  
        {  
            float balance = 500;  
            float deposit_amount;  
            float withdraw_amount;  
            int user_selection;  
            int pin = 1234;  
            int active_session = 1;  
            Console.WriteLine("Please enter your PIN: ");  
            int pin_entered = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());  
            if (pin == pin_entered)  
                while (active_session == 1)  
                {  
                    Console.WriteLine("1. Balance       2. Withdraw\n");  
                    Console.WriteLine("3. Deposit       4. Exit\n");  
                    Console.WriteLine("Please make a selection: ");  
                    user_selection = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());  
                    switch (user_selection)  
                    {  
                        case 1:  
                            Console.WriteLine("\n Your current balance is : {0} ", balance);  
                            break;  
                        case 2:  
                            Console.WriteLine("\n Please enter the amount to withdraw: ");  
                            withdraw_amount = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine());  
                            if (withdraw_amount > balance)  
                            {  
                                Console.WriteLine("\n You do not have a sufficient funds for that transaction.");  
                            }  
                            else  
                            {  
                                balance = balance - withdraw_amount;  
                                Console.WriteLine("\n Your new balance is:  {0}", balance);  
                                Console.WriteLine("\n\n Please collect your cash and remove your card. ");  
                            }  
                            break;  
                        case 3:  
                            Console.WriteLine("\n Please enter the amount to deposit: ");  
                            deposit_amount = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine());  
                            balance = balance + deposit_amount;  
                            Console.WriteLine("Your new balance is {0}", balance);  
                            break;  
                        case 4:  
                            Console.WriteLine("\n Thank you. Goodbye.");  
                            active_session = 0;  
                            break;  
                    }  
                }  
            else if (pin != pin_entered)  
                Console.WriteLine("\n Incorrect PIN. Goodbye.");  
        }  
    }  

```

It seems clear that my future productivity in C# relies on learning to navigate Visual Studio and the basics of the .NET framework. In the coming week, I intend to work my way through an introductory tutorial for both.
