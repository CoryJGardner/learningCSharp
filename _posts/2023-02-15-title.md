title: "Week 3: Visual Studio and Bluetooth"
date: 2023-01-25

This week I learned a bit more about Visual Studio Community Edition, such as how to us the package manager (NuGet) and otherwise find my way through the vast array of VS options.  
One of my goals for the week was to discover and pair to a bluetooth device in a console application.  I have been partially succeessful:

```
using InTheHand.Net.Bluetooth;

public class bt_discovery
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // bt discovery
        var client = new BluetoothClient();
        var devices = client.DiscoverDevices();

        // print discovered devices
        foreach (var device in devices)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{device.DeviceAddress} ({device.DeviceName})");
        }
    }
}
```

Two things surprised me from this exercise:
   1. How incredibly difficult it was to get the right packages installed.  It took several tried, each time working through a number of .NET framework and other version issues.
   2. After getting things installed, how incredibly easy it was to discover and print the bluetooth devices that were in range.

In the coming week, I plan to expand on this by writing a small application to control the volume on my BT earbuds.  Even though we probably won't use C# for the course project, I think it will be useful to become familiar with BT discovery, pairing, and communication.
