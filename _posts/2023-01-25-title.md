This semester, I am taking CSCI 5300 Software Engineering at Saint Louis University. One requirement of the course is to learn a new programming language. Settling on a language was not easy! Among the more attractive options were Ruby, Rust, Julia, Kotlin, and Go. In the end, I've chosen C#. My decision was based on the following:

* Cross platform (Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS)
* High demand (Consistently in the top 10, according to various metrics)
* Mature language with thorough documentation and strong support community
* Open source (Since 2014)

For my first day of study, I (re)installed Visual Studio (C#'s native IDE) with C# support, researched the languages basic syntax and framework, and identified a couple online tutorials that look promising. I don't have any code to share yet, but that will come soon!
