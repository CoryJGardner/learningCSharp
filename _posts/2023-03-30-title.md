Several aspects of the course thus far proved useful in completing the C# Mini-project, most notably communication in teams, how to clearly define project goals and requirements, and the use of regular expressions.  The group worked well together, with everyone participating equally to the accomplishing the task.  In addition, we worked together to solve problems such as incompatability of certain libraries with particular versions of the .NET framework.  The main challenge we faced involved the Visual Studio GitHub integration module.  We actually spent far more time trying to resolve the issues we ran into with the GitHub integration than we did in coding.
