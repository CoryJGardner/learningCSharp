Several aspects of the course thus far proved useful in completing the C# Mini-project, most notably skills revolving around communication in teams, clearly defining project goals and requirements, and the use of regular expressions.  The group worked well together, with everyone participating equally to accomplishing the task.  In addition, we worked together to solve problems such as incompatability of certain libraries with particular versions of the .NET framework.  The main challenge we faced involved the Visual Studio GitHub integration module.  We actually spent far more time trying to resolve the issues we ran into with the GitHub integration than we did in coding.  (The problem came from my end, but my teammates stuck with me for hours to resolve it. They are great!)  Even though the project is very simple, it was actually fun to work on. We have discussed developing it further into a "weather dashboard" for our mobile devices.
