title: "Week 3: Accessing remote APIs"
date: 2023-02-22

While I intended to extend my bluetooth pairing from last week to control my wireless earbuds, I ran into a few issues that I wasn't able to resolve.  I needed access to a particular SDK that I was not able to find. Instead, I decided to explore how to use C# and the .NET framework to access remote APIs.  With a little help from ChatGPT, I implemented a weather app.  First, I had to get an API key from OpenWeatherMap.com.  After that, it was surprisingly simple.


```
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace WeatherApp
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        private const string API_KEY = "2038b1498e6941f0867230d44acc56e0";
        private const string API_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={0}&appid={1}&units=metric";

        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            _httpClient = new HttpClient();
        }

        private async void btnGetWeather_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string location = txtLocation.Text.Trim();
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(location))
            {
                string url = string.Format(API_URL, location, API_KEY);
                HttpResponseMessage response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);

                if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
                {
                    string json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    WeatherData data = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherData>(json);

                    lblTemperature.Text = string.Format("{0}Â°C", data.Main.Temp);
                    lblCondition.Text = data.Weather[0].Description;
                }
            }
        }

        private class WeatherData
        {
            public MainData Main { get; set; }
            public Weather[] Weather { get; set; }
        }

        private class MainData
        {
            public double Temp { get; set; }
        }

        private class Weather
        {
            public string Description { get; set; }
        }
    }
}
```

The main challenges I ran into involved making sure I had the appropriate packages installed and the proper .NET framework version.  For example, I initially tried to use JavaScriptSerializer, which is apparantly not available in .NET framework 6.0.  It also took a little time to get used to the form designer.
