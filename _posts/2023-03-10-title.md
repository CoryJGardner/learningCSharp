This week I've been experimenting with the Tizen .NET and C#.  Like a fair amount of my C# journey so far, it has largely been a series of challenges in dealing with package installations.  This time, it stems from inaccurate (or perhaps simply not up-to-date) Samsung documentation.

First, I installed Visual Studio Tools For Tizen from the Samsung developer site. It is a Visual Studio extension that links the VS IDE with the Tizen software development kit. After that, I installed the Tizen SDK through the Tizen package manager, which was included in the above extension package.  It took a couple of tried to get it to work.  (It didn't work when I installed the SDK in my Program Files folder, but it was fine when I put it in my home directory. I have not been able to identify why, other than possible file permissions issues.)

Finally, with some significant help from sample codespaces, I was able to 


```
using Samsung.Sap;
using Samsung.Sap.Channel;
using Samsung.Sap.Message;

// Connect to the Galaxy Watch 5
SapConnection connection = new SapConnection();
SapPeerAgent peerAgent = connection.GetPeerAgents(SapPeerAgentType.ACCESSORY)[0];
SapChannel channel = peerAgent.CreateChannel();
channel.Open();

// Send a message to the Galaxy Watch 5
SapMessage message = new SapMessage();
message.SetPayload("Hello Galaxy Watch!");
channel.SendMessage(SapChannelID.CHANNEL_ID_SAP, message);

// Receive a message from the Galaxy Watch 5
SapMessage receivedMessage = channel.ReceiveMessage(SapChannelID.CHANNEL_ID_SAP);
string payload = receivedMessage.GetPayloadAsString();
```
